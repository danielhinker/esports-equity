              <p>eSports Equity is a brand new funding portal formed under the JOBS act of 2012.
                  We operate under title 3 of the law known as reg CF,
                  which allows investors from across the entirety of the financial spectrum.
                  This means investors with <span style="color: #0089ff; text-decoration: underline">$10,000</span> in assets have access to the <span style="color: #0089ff; text-decoration: underline">same</span> investment opportunities
                  as investors with <span style="color: #0089ff; text-decoration: underline">$10,000,000</span> in assets.  </p>

                  looking for money to grow their brand. Investors could range from outside investors

              <p><span style="color: #0089ff; text-decoration: underline">It depends on your needs.</span> We suggest that if you need to raise a lot of money then leave enough
                  time for enough people to see your offerings over a few months.
                  If you only need a small capital injection, then you can have a shorter campaign of a few weeks.

              <p>You create an account on our website and access the page of the team/company you want to invest in.

                Are there minimum and maximum investment limits?<span class="faqglyphicon glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-down"></span>
            </button>
          <div id="answer9" class="collapse well">
              <p>These are based on limitations set by the company raising money. These limits are applied to investors so if for example,
                  a company sets a <span style="color: #0089ff; text-decoration: underline">$50.00</span> limit on the team then someone looking to invest any amount lower than
                  <span style="color: #0089ff; text-decoration: underline">$50.00</span> would be unable to do so.
                  Likewise with a maximum limit of <span style="color: #0089ff; text-decoration: underline">$50.00</span>, anyone looking to invest more than
                  <span style="color: #0089ff; text-decoration: underline">$50.00</span> would be unable to do so.

            </button>
          <div id="answer10" class="collapse well">
              <p>We are operating under the laws and regulations of the United States of America,
                  there may be other countries with laws similar that allow investment but we <span style="color: #0089ff; text-decoration: underline">cannot</span> make any
                  recommendations for any investors outside of the U.S. who might want to utilize our service.
                  If you fall under this category, we strongly suggest you update yourself on the laws in your
                  country to see if you can legally invest.

                How do investors get their money back?<span class="faqglyphicon glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-down"></span>
            </button>
          <div id="answer12" class="collapse well">
              <p>Traditionally investors get their money back from startups when those startups get acquired or when they have an IPO
                  (when a company gets listed on the stock market).
                  eSports based companies probably wonâ€™t be going public anytime soon so the most likely return will come from acquisitions.
